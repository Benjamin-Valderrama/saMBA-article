# The South American MicroBiome Archive (saMBA)

This repository hosts the code used to generate the main outputs and figures presented in the article: [The South American MicroBiome Archive (saMBA):  Enriching the healthy microbiome concept by evaluating uniqueness and biodiversity of neglected populations](no link yet). The code used to build saMBA can be accessed in the GitHub repository ['saMBA-pipeline'](https://github.com/Benjamin-Valderrama/saMBA-pipeline). 

### Analysing of saMBA

The scripts in this repository were used to analyse the saMBA count tables generated by using the workflow described in the GitHub repository ['saMBA-pipeline'](https://github.com/Benjamin-Valderrama/saMBA-pipeline). Read the associated wiki for an in-depth discussion about how the workflow operates. If you are interested in replicating the analysis, you could use that workflow to build saMBA in your own machine. Alternatively, you could download the outputs we generated with that workflow and shared in the associated [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/uploads/15050380). 

Regardles of how you generate your local copy, the count tables should then be stored in the folder `samba/inputs/` of this repository, so they can be accessible to the code we provided in the `scripts/` folder. The code should work with the current version of saMBA (v0.1.0). The scripts will be changed accordingly whenever saMBA is updated with future samples.

### Contribute to saMBA 
saMBA was disigned in a way that is easy to mantain and expand. If you have conducted a microbiome analysis in South American populations and you are interested in incluiding your project in saMBA, please open an Issue in this repository so it can be added in the next version of saMBA.

### Final note
Although users might use the code of this repository to analyse their local copies of saMBA, the content of this repository is intended to be used as extended methods (see [Box 1](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011920)).
